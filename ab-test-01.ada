--/ Fragment 1

   --| Some random commentary
 about how wonderful the world is
 which goes on and on forever, rambling about all manner of
 silly little things that seem to be of great importance to
 the author, but which in reality all all part of the ephemera of life. Yet
 still the bugger waffles on and on incessantly. Good grief!
